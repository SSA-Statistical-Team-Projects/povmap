## Overview

The R package povmap is designed to facilitate the production 
of small area estimates of means and poverty headcount rates. It adds several 
new features to the [emdi](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emdi) package. 
These include new options for:

* incorporating survey weights, 
* ex-post benchmarking of estimates, 
* two additional outcome variable transformations, 
* and several new convenience functions to assist with reporting results.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## To install the package from CRAN, run the following in R: 

install.packages("povmap")

```

## Development Version

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install 
## the development version of povmap from GitHub. Sometimes, povmap maybe unavailable in CRAN (although this is typically ## unlikely)

devtools::install_github("SSA-Statistical-Team-Projects/povmap")
## alternatively (remove the comment for the line of code below),
##remotes::install_github("SSA-Statistical-Team-Projects/povmap")

```

## Usage
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(povmap)

### estimate a unit level model with sample and population weights
ebp_model <- ebp(fixed = eqIncome ~ gender + eqsize + cash +
                 self_empl + unempl_ben + age_ben + surv_ben + sick_ben +
                 dis_ben + rent + fam_allow + house_allow + cap_inv +
                 tax_adj,
                 pop_data = eusilcA_pop, 
                 pop_domains = "district",
                 smp_data = eusilcA_smp, 
                 smp_domains = "district",
                 na.rm = TRUE, 
                 weights = "weight",
                 pop_weights = "hhsize", 
                 MSE = TRUE, 
                 weights_type = "nlme",
                 B = 2, 
                 L = 2)

summary(ebp_model)

### showcasing the actual poverty map
load_shapeaustria()  ## reading in the shapefile

## the new `map_plot` now requires sf shapefile objects
## rather than the older `sp` (it's dependencies are being phased out)
map_plot(object = ebp_model, 
         MSE = FALSE, 
         CV = FALSE, 
         map_obj = shape_austria_dis, 
         indicator = c("Head_Count"), 
         map_dom_id = "PB")


###### ---------------------------------------------------- #######
# compute direct estimates 
direct_est <- direct(y = "eqIncome", 
                     smp_data = eusilcA_smp,
                     smp_domains = "district", 
                     weights = "weight",
                     var = TRUE, 
                     B = 2)

### some general pre-estimation statistics
ebp_reportdescriptives(model = ebp_model, 
                       direct = direct_est,
                       smp_data = eusilcA_smp, 
                       weights = "weight",
                       pop_weights = "hhsize", 
                       CV_level = "state",
                       pop_data = eusilcA_pop, 
                       pop_domains = "district")


### compare the means between survey and census prior to model estimation
variables <- c("gender", "eqsize", "cash", "self_empl",
               "unempl_ben", "age_ben", "surv_ben",
               "sick_ben", "dis_ben", "rent", "fam_allow",
               "house_allow", "cap_inv", "tax_adj")

ebp_test_means(varlist = variables,
               pop_data = eusilcA_pop,
               smp_data = eusilcA_smp,
               weights = "weight")

### report EBP model coefficients with significance levels
ebp_reportcoef_table(ebp_model, 4)


### compute the CVs (several CV types are estimated including
### Horowitz Thompson CVs, CVs accounting for the design effect,
### bootstraped CVs i.e. calibrated or naive)
head(ebp_compute_cv(model = ebp_model, calibvar = "gender"))

### report the model fit and normality assumptions
ebp_normalityfit(model = ebp_model)

```
